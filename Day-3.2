Approach 1 :
iterate through 1 to n and 
just multiply and get the answer
but some times it give runtime error

Approach 2 :
here 2 possiblites 
the power is odd or even  .
we consider one answer varible .
then check and pertform until our n be 
a 0 . 

if(n%2==0) 
answer * = x 
n--;

else 
x =x*x ;
n/=2


explanation => 

Number is 4  
Power  is 6 

we check Power is Odd or even 
here even 
then we multiply no.* no. 
(4*4)=>(16)^3 

here we use the Math concepts in Multiplication power 
will be add if base is same.
