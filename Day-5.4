Approach 1 : 
To Connect with the Solution of This Problem
We just Calculate the Number of Node Count and remove with 
given deleted node so we get Some Number we iterate loop
ubtil that point reaches and just set the point = point.next.next 

this gives the deleted element in the linkedlist. 

while(temp!=null)
{
    count++;
    head=head.next;
}

while(index<=count-given)
{
    dummy=dumm.next;
}
dumm = dummy.Next.next;



Approach 2: 

here again we Use the tortoise method where we 
first iterate the until our fast get the index==deleted

then we start to move slow and fast as we hit fast==null
we  get that element and just do dumm = dummy.Next.next; and 
return ; 


while(i<deleted)
{
    fast=fast.next;
    cnt++;
}
while(fast.next!=null)
{
    fast=fast.next;
    slow = slow.next;
} 
slow = slow.next.next;
return head;
