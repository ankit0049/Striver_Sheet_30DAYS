(using Sorting & Linear Searching)
Approach 1 : Using HashMap count Freq.and tell
the repeat Number 

Approach 2 : Using Array Hasing Techniques 
 count agin element freq.

Approach  3 : let take sum of 1 to n 
then do xor with the array and return the left is the 
repeating one 

(2^2=0)same  number or even freq. number  xor  is 0  

[1,2,5,4,4,3] find repeating

sum = 1 + 2 + 3+ 4+ 4+5 
then xor 

ans = (1+2+3+4+4+5)^(1 + 2 + 3 +4 +5)
(1^1) &(2^2)&(3^3)&(4^4^4)+(5^5)
 0    +  0  + 0   +  4     + 0  = 4 

 4 is the repeating number
