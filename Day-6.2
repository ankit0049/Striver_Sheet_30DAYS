Approach 1 : 
Using THe HashMap we Store The Node not the Value
and iterate on list if we getting same on HashMap
means Cycle Exists if our Loop break bu condition 
getting null means there is no loop in Linked list.



Approach 2 : 
Tortoise Approach 
here We have 2 Pointer Slow & Fast 
slow one Move BY 1 step 
fast one Move BY 2 step likewise
if we get slow == fast then cycle is
present if not means we hit the condition of getting
null and break the loop;

Public static void Find(Node head)
{
    Node slow = head;
    Node fast = head;
    while(fast!=null && fast.next!=null)
    {
        if(fast==slow)
        {
            return true;
        } 

        fast=fast.next.next;
        slow = slow.next;
    } return false;
}
