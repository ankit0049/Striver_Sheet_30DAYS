Approach : 

We Iterate on the Linkedlist 
to begin with we make one dummy node = null 

and store the next address and head point to dummy node 
and update the head = next likewise 
we Iterate on whole linkedlist so that head goes at the end and link 
is reverse pointed so We get Recrsed LinkedList 


Code 


Public static void LikedReverse(Node head)
{
 Node dummy = null ;
 while(head!=null)
 {
    Node next = head.next; 
    head.next=dummy;
    dummy = head;
    head = next;
 } 
 return head;
}
