/* 
   Sort 0 ,1's & 2's (without Sorting) 
Approach 1 : brute force Approach is we just take 3 counter varible for count 0 ,1 & 2's then iterate loop for everone until count is not zero and stored in the array so we get [0,0,0,1,1,1,2,2,2] like this 

Approach 2 : National Dutch Man Flag ALoritham  
in this method we have 3 pointer low mid and high  to begin with low=0 , mid=0  high = n-1  we have 3 checks  
1. arr[mid]==0 => then we do swap (low++,mid++) and increse by one both  

2. arr[mid]==2 => then we have swap(mid ,high--) here we decre the high only 

3. arr[mid]==1 so this is right position so we increse mid+1
